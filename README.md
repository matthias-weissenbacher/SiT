# SiT
This repository contains supplementary code for the paper "Symmetry-invariant Transformers for Generalisation in Reinforcement Learning," accepted at ICML 2024.

# Reproduce Our Results
As our SiT model is tested on top of multiple RL backbone algorithms, we provide a step-by-step guide in the Readme files of the respective folders in this repo on how to modify the code-bases, respectively. 

# A Simple SiT module via pip-install
Under development... Currently available: the respective SiT model codes for architecture with different symmetry properties are contained in the folders.
